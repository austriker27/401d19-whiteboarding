# Whiteboarding
## Professional Tips and Strategy
### From Big V

Remember, whatever you do, don't get frustrated.

### Steps To Take
- Re-state the problem
  - ask a lot of questions!
    - what's the input
    - what's the output
    - edge cases
      - null or undefined
      - empty things
      - duplicate values
      - incorrect types
      - mix of data values
    - assumptions
- work through an example, and test for edge cases
- think about implementation, pseudo code an answer
- write out the code
- test the code with correct input and edge cases

### More Tips
- talk about problem solving as you do it
  - otherwise, think out loud
- if you are stuck, start talking 
- Don't ask for help or confirmation

### Personal feedback for me from interviewers:
- spend more time on the problem itself and white boarding
- Improve on learning Big O time and memory (extra space generated)
- refactor in pseudo code not real code
- test examples (at least 1) in pseudo code
- **practice syntax without a computer (on paper!)**
- practice looking confident
