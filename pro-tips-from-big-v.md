### From Big V

Remember, whatever you do, don't get frustrated.

### Steps To Take
- Re-state the problem
  - ask a lot of questions!
    - what's the input
    - what's the output
    - edge cases
      - null or undefined
      - empty things
      - duplicate values
      - incorrect types
      - mix of data values
    - assumptions
- work through an example, and test for edge cases
- think about implementation, psuedo code an answer
- write out the code
- test the code with correct input and edge cases

### More Tips
- talk about problem solving as you do it
  - otherwise, think out loud
- if you are stuck, start talking 
- Don't ask for help or confirmation
